    "This week is going to focus on the Python package Pandas. However, Pandas (and many other Python packages) are built on NumPy arrays. NumPy is another Python module, and NumPy arrays are multi-dimensional datasets made up entirely of numerical data. They allow for much faster calculations than other basic Python objects. If you work with large numerical datasets, you will also want to look into the NumPy package. NumPy arrays do not have the features that many of us want to work with, such as column headers and the ability to work with non-numerical data; that's why pandas is so popular."

How do you choose all animals that are aquatic? **Selecting data** is a big part of working with pandas DataFrames, but there are actually multiple ways to do it. Tomorrow we are going to focus only on selecting data. For the rest of today, we're going to practice several common tasks you'll want to do that don't involve selecting data. I don't expect you to memorize exactly how to do all these tasks today, but the info will be here for when you need it, plus, we will get practice with some common pandas syntax."
